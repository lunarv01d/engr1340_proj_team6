### Introduction

Project Classroom is a completely open source LMS ( Learning Management System ) that aims to make online learning easier for all parties involved. From Students and Teacher to Administrators, todays online learning systems are complicated to the point where teams of people are needed for the smooth operation of even a single system. Whit Project Classroom, we aim to simplify this problem into one easy to use system that feels familiar yet fresh and new. We want students to be able to learn, not have to learn the website.
